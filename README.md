##Getting and Cleaning Data

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

###Course Project

*Unzip the data from source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip into a folder on your local drive, example: C:\Users\xxx\Desktop\coursera.  

*After unzip, you will see a folder: UCI HAR Dataset.

*Put run_analysis.R into C:\Users\xxx\Desktop\coursera. Do not put run_analysis.R into the unzip folder(UCI HAR Dataset), run_analysis.R should be in the same directory as folder(UCI HAR Dataset).

*In RStudio: setwd("C:\\Users\\xxx\\Desktop\\coursera\\"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R").

*You will see two additional files: "data_set_with_averages_of_each_variable.txt" and "merged_tidy_data.txt" in C:\Users\xxx\Desktop\coursera.
